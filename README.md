# Shark-tank-pitches-in-R
The primary goal of this project was to explore and evaluate the predictive capabilities of various factors influencing the success of ventures pitched on Shark Tank. The aim was to develop a comprehensive understanding of these predictive factors, especially concerning projects targeting non-profit organizations. The venture proposed an app-based marketplace facilitating furniture donation and acquisition to tackle environmental concerns and community needs. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was utilized for feature selection, and logistic regression was employed for predictive analytics, aiming to forecast the success or failure of the pitch. By leveraging historical data and extracting pertinent patterns, this analysis identifies influential predictors, enabling informed decision-making, resource allocation, and business model refinement for aspiring entrepreneurs.
